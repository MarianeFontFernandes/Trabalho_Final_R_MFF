abstract={Background: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent and life-threatening illness in modern society. The susceptibility to major depressive disorder is profoundly influenced by environmental factors, such as stressful lifestyle or traumatic events, which could impose maladaptive transcriptional program through epigenetic regulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we examined the role of histone crotonylation, a novel type of histone modification, and chromodomain Y-like protein (CDYL), a crotonyl-coenzyme A hydratase and histone methyllysine reader, in this process. Methods: We used chronic social defeat stress and microdefeat stress to examine the depressive behaviors. In addition, we combined procedures that diagnose behavioral strategy in male mice with histone extraction, viral-mediated CDYL manipulations, RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and messenger RNA quantification. Results: The results indicate that stress-susceptible rodents exhibit lower levels of histone crotonylation in the medial prefrontal cortex concurrent with selective upregulation of CDYL. Overexpression of CDYL in the prelimbic cortex, a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex, increases microdefeat-induced social avoidance behaviors and anhedonia in mice. Conversely, knockdown of CDYL in the prelimbic cortex prevents chronic social defeat stress–induced depression-like behaviors. Mechanistically, we show that CDYL inhibits structural synaptic plasticity mainly by transcriptional repression of neuropeptide VGF nerve growth factor inducible, and this activity is dependent on its dual effect on histone crotonylation and H3K27 trimethylation on the VGF promoter. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that CDYL-mediated histone crotonylation plays a critical role in regulating stress-induced depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for major depressive disorder. © 2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation is a new posttranslational modification (PTM) type identified on histones, which is enriched on active gene promoters or potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. However, the function of lysine crotonylation in the cancer process is not known. Intriguingly, we found that lysine crotonylation expression is down-regulated in liver, stomach, kidney carcinomas, and up-regulated in thyroid, esophagus, colon, pancreas and lung carcinomas. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lysine crotonylation expression is correlated with Tumour, Node, and Metastasis (TNM) stage. Besides, the crotonylation level is increased by knocking down HDACs or adding HDACs inhibitor, TSA, and thus inhibits hepatoma cell motility and proliferation. Taken together, our findings opened up a new field for the investigation and understanding of the biological role of lysine crotonylation. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Proteomic analysis of histones has shown that they are subject to a superabundance of acylations, which extend far beyond acetylation, to include: crotonylation, propionylation, butyrylation, malonylation, succinylation, β-hydroxybutyrylation and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation. To date, much of the functional data has focussed on histone crotonylation which, similar to acetylation, has been associated with positive gene regulation and is added by the acyltransferase, p300. Although Sirtuins 1–3, along with HDAC3, have been shown to possess decrotonylase activity in vitro, there is relatively little known about the regulation of histone crotonylation in vivo. Here we show that Histone Deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2), the catalytic core of numerous co-repressor complexes, are important histone decrotonylase enzymes. A ternary complex of HDAC1/CoREST1/LSD1 is able to hydrolyse both histone H3 Lys18-acetyl (H3K18ac) and H3 Lys18-crotonyl (H3K18cr) peptide substrates. Genetic deletion of HDAC1/2 in ES cells increases global levels of histone crotonylation and causes an 85% reduction in total decrotonylase activity. Furthermore, we mapped H3K18cr in cells using ChIP-seq, with and without HDAC1/2, and observed increased levels of crotonylation, which largely overlaps with H3K18ac in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites. Collectively, our data indicate that HDAC1/2 containing complexes are critical regulators of histone crotonylation in vivo. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation of histone proteins is a recently-identified post-translational modification with multiple cellular functions. However, no information about lysine crotonylation of non-histone proteins in fruit cells is available. Using high-resolution LC-MS/MS coupled with highly sensitive immune-affinity antibody analysis, a global crotonylation proteome analysis of papaya fruit (Carica papaya L.) was performed. In total, 2,120 proteins with 5,995 lysine crotonylation sites were discovered, among which eight conserved motifs were identified. Bioinformatic analysis linked crotonylated proteins to multiple metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of antibiotics, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and glycolysis. particularly, 40 crotonylated enzymes involved in various pathways of amino acid metabolism were identified, suggesting a potential conserved function for crotonylation in the regulation of amino acid metabolism. Numerous crotonylation sites were identified in proteins involved in the hormone signaling and cell wall-related pathways. Our comprehensive crotonylation proteome indicated diverse functions for lysine crotonylation in papaya. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Zebrafish embryos are translucent and develop rapidly in individual eggs ex utero; they are widely used as models for embryogenesis and organ development for human diseases and drug discovery. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a type of histone post-translational modifications discovered in 2011. Kcr dynamics are involved in gene expression regulation and acute kidney injury; however, little is known about the effects of Kcr on non-histone proteins. In the present study, we conducted the first proteome-wide profiling of Kcr in zebrafish larvae and identified 557 Kcr sites on 218 proteins, representing the Kcr event in zebrafish. We identified two types of Kcr motifs containing hydrophobic (Leu, Ile, Val) and acidic (Asp and Glu) amino acids near the modified lysine residues. Our results show that both crotonylated proteins and sites of crotonylation were evolutionarily conserved between zebrafish embryos and humans. Specifically, Kcr on ribosomal proteins and myofilament proteins, including myosin, tropomyosin and troponin, were widely enriched. Interestingly, 55 lysine crotonylation sites on myosin were distributed throughout coiled coil regions. Therefore, Kcr may regulate muscle contraction and protein synthesis. Our results provide a foundation for future studies on the effects of lysine crotonylation on aging and heart failure. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The recently discovered histone post-translational modification crotonylation connects cellularmetabolism to gene regulation. Its regulation and tissue-specific functions are poorlyunderstood. We characterize histone crotonylation in intestinal epithelia and find that histoneH3 crotonylation at lysine 18 is a surprisingly abundant modification in the small intestinecrypt and colon, and is linked to gene regulation. We show that this modification is highlydynamic and regulated during the cell cycle. We identify class I histone deacetylases, HDAC1,HDAC2, and HDAC3, as major executors of histone decrotonylation. We show that knownHDAC inhibitors, including the gut microbiota-derived butyrate, affect histone decrotonylation.Consistent with this, we find that depletion of the gut microbiota leads to a globalchange in histone crotonylation in the colon. Our results suggest that histone crotonylationconnects chromatin to the gut microbiota, at least in part, via short-chain fatty acids andHDACs. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered posttranslational modification (PTM) existing in mammals. A global crotonylome analysis was undertaken in rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) using high accuracy nano-LCMS/ MS in combination with crotonylated peptide enrichment. A total of 1,265 lysine crotonylation sites were identified on 690 proteins in rice seedlings. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that 51% of the crotonylated proteins identified were localized in chloroplasts. The photosynthesis-associated proteins were also mostly enriched in total crotonylated proteins. In addition, a genomic localization analysis of histone Kcr by ChIP-seq was performed to assess the relevance between histone Kcr and the genome. Of the 10,923 identified peak regions, the majority (86.7%) of the enriched peaks were located in gene body, especially exons. Furthermore, the degree of histone Kcr modification was positively correlated with gene expression in genic regions. Compared with other published histone modification data, the Kcr was co-located with the active histone modifications. Interestingly, histone Kcr-facilitated expression of genes with existing active histone modifications. In addition, 77% of histone Kcr modifications overlapped with DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in intergenic regions of the rice genome and might mark other cis-regulatory DNA elements that are different from IPA1, a transcription activator in rice seedlings. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological functions of the crotonylome and new active histone modification in transcriptional regulation in plants. © 2018 Liu et al.},

abstract={Background: Histone lysine acylations by short-chain fatty acids are distinct from the widely studied histone lysine acetylation in chromatin, although both modifications are regulated by primary metabolism in mammalian cells. It remains unknown whether and how histone acylation and acetylation interact to regulate gene expression in plants that have distinct regulatory pathways of primary metabolism. Results: We identify 4 lysine butyrylation (Kbu) sites (H3K14, H4K12, H2BK42, and H2BK134) and 45 crotonylation (Kcr) sites on rice histones by mass spectrometry. Comparative analysis of genome-wide Kbu and Kcr and H3K9ac in combination with RNA sequencing reveals 25,306 genes marked by Kbu and Kcr in rice and more than 95% of H3K9ac-marked genes are marked by both. Kbu and Kcr are enriched at the 5′ region of expressed genes. In rice under starvation and submergence, Kbu and Kcr appear to be less dynamic and display changes in different sets of genes compared to H3K9ac. Furthermore, Kbu seems to preferentially poise gene activation by external stresses, rather than internal circadian rhythm which has been shown to be tightly associated with H3K9ac. In addition, we show that rice sirtuin histone deacetylase (SRT2) is involved in the removal of Kcr. Conclusion: Kbu, Kcr, and H3K9ac redundantly mark a large number of active genes but display different responses to external and internal signals. Thus, the proportion of rice histone lysine acetylation and acylation is dynamically regulated by environmental and metabolic cues, which may represent an epigenetic mechanism to fine-tune gene expression for plant adaptation. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation is a newly discovered protein acylation and was reported to share acyltransferases and deacylases with the widely studied lysine acetylation. The well-known acetyltransferase Tip60 and histone deacetylases HDAC 2 and HDAC 3 were discovered to be "writer" and "eraser" of this new PTM on histones. However, the acyltransferases and deacylases for nonhistone proteins are still unclear. In this work, lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome on both histones and nonhistone proteins upon SAHA treatment were intensively studied and 8765 lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation sites on 2484 proteins were identified in A549 cells. This is the largest data set of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome in mammalian cells to date. It was found that lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation participates in varieties of biological functions and processes including ribosome, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and transcription. More importantly, it was found that most quantified sites on core histones were up-regulated upon SAHA treatment for all 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, crotonylation, and acetylation and the fold changes upon SAHA of 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation and crotonylation on nonhistone proteins were highly correlated, while their fold changes have little correlations with acetylation on nonhistone proteins. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin produced by some Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys species. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is able to degrade PAT in vivo as well as in vitro, up till date, the process and molecular mechanism(s) involved patulin degradation still remains unknown. Protein lysine crotonylation (Kcr) plays an important role in regulating chromatin dynamics, gene expression, and metabolic pathways in mammals and eukaryotes. Investigation of the Kcr changes accompanying degradation of patulin in R. mucilaginosa were observed to investigate the mechanisms of patulin inhibition. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and Kcro affinity enrichment, followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis, were used to perform quantitative lysine crotonylome analysis on R. mucilaginosa. Consequently, 1691 lysine crotonylation sites in 629 protein groups were identified, among which we quantified 1457 sites in 562 proteins. Among the quantified proteins, 79 and 46 crotonylated proteins were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. The differentially up expressed modified proteins were mainly involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenic pathway. The differentially down expressed Kcr proteins were mainly classified to ribosome and carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to annotate the quantifiable lysine crotonylated targets. Moreover, interaction networks and high confidence domain architectures of crotonylated proteins were investigated with the aid of bioinformatic tools, and these results showed that there was an increase in the number of yeasts with crotonylated proteins. The results also provided information on the various roles of crotonylation, which are involved in PAT degradation. © 2018 Yang, Li, Apaliya, Zheng, Serwah, Zhang and Zhang.},

abstract={Introduction: Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) carry epigenetic information to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level. Crotonylation, one of the most important and common PTMs, plays a key role in the regulation of various biological processes. However, no study has evaluated the role of lysine crotonylation in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHP). Methods: Here, we comparatively evaluated the crotonylation proteome of normal controls (NC) and MHP using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with highly sensitive immune-affinity purification. Results: A total of 1109 lysine modification sites distributed on 347 proteins were identified, including 93 and 252 crotonylated upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively. Thus, a decrease in crotonylation of histone proteins was observed in patients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Intensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that most of the crotonylated proteins were distributed in the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular region. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the crotonylated proteins were significantly enriched in the platelet alpha granule lumen, platelet degranulation, and cell adhesion molecule binding. In addition, protein domain, including fibrinogen alpha/beta/gamma chain, zinc finger, and WD40-repeat-containing domain, were significantly enriched in crotonylated proteins. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-based functional enrichment analysis revealed that crotonylated proteins were enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, cardiac muscle contraction, and hematopoietic cell lineage, all of which have important associations with hemodialysis complications. Conclusions: This is the first report on the global crotonylation proteome of MHP. Lysine crotonylation was found to play important regulatory roles in pathophysiological processes in MHP.

abstract={Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an evolution-conserved histone posttranslational modification (PTM), occurring in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes. It is important for male germ cell differentiation. Information of Kcr sites in proteins is very useful for both basic research and drug development. But it is time-consuming and expensive to determine them by experiments alone. Here, we report a novel predictor called iKcr-PseEns that is established by incorporating five tiers of amino acid pairwise couplings into the general pseudo amino acid composition. It has been observed via rigorous cross-validations that the new predictor's sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and stability (MCC) are 90.53%, 95.27%, 94.49%, and 0.826, respectively. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iKcr-PseEns has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iKcr-PseEns, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a recently identified post-translational modification (PTM) that is regulated by an acetyltransferase, p300. The p300-catalyzed histone Kcr is able to stimulate transcription to a greater degree than the well-studied histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Despite these progresses, the global Kcr substrates regulated by p300 remain largely unknown, hindering efforts to establish mechanistic links between Kcr and p300-mediated phenotypes. Here, a quantitative proteomics study to characterize the p300-regulated lysine crotonylome is reported. A total of 816 unique endogenous crotonylation sites are identified across 392 proteins, with 88 sites from 69 proteins being decreased by more than 0.7-fold (log2 < 0.5) and 31 sites from 17 proteins being increased by more than 1.4-fold (log2 > 0.5) in response to p300 knockout (KO). The most downregulated crotonylome alterations under p300 deficiency concern components of the nonsense-mediated decay, infectious disease, and viral/eukaryotic translation pathways. Moreover, some p300-targeted Kcr substrates are potentially linked to diseases such as cancer. Taken together, this study reveals the lysine crotonylome in response to p300, which sheds light on the role for lysine crotonylation in regulation of diverse cellular processes and provides new insights into mechanisms of p300 functions. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Objective • To study whether lysine crotonylation can be used as a candidate biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis, and its correlation with clinical stages and pathologic grades. Methods • Seventy-three cases of tumor and 7 normal prostate tissues were included in the study. The global levels of lysine crotonylation and histone H4 acetylation were detected in each sample by immunohistochemistry. Statistical comparison and correlation analysis were performed. Results • Compared with normal prostate tissue, the global level of lysine crotonylation was significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissue (P=0.001), while histone H4 acetylation levels were close to each other in two groups (P=0.704). No statistical difference in the levels of lysine crotonylation or histone H4 acetylation were found in different clinical stages and pathologic grades (P>0.05). There was no correlation between histone H4 acetylation and clinical stages or pathologic grades of prostate cancer. There was a positive correlation between lysine crotonylation and the grading of prostate cancer (r=0.493, P=0.000). Conclusion • Compared to histone H4 acetylation, lysine crotonylation is a better candidate biomarker to diagnose prostate cancer. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

abstract={Protein lysine crotonylation has emerged as an important post-translational modification (PTM) in the regulation of gene transcription through epigenetic mechanisms. Here we introduce a chemical probe, based on a water-soluble phosphine warhead, which reacts with the crotonyl modification. We show that this reagent is complementary to antibody-based tools allowing detection of endogenous cellular proteins such as histones carrying the crotonylation PTM. The tool is also used to show that the histone acylation activity of the transcriptional coactivator, p300, can be activated by pre-existing lysine crotonylation through a positive feedback mechanism. This reagent provides a versatile and sensitive probe for the analysis of this PTM. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Eradication of HIV-1 (HIV) is hindered by stable viral reservoirs. Viral latency is epigenetically regulated. While the effects of histone acetylation and methylation at the HIV long-terminal repeat (LTR) have been described, our knowledge of the proviral epigenetic landscape is incomplete. We report that a previously unrecognized epigenetic modification of the HIV LTR, histone crotonylation, is a regulator of HIV latency. Reactivation of latent HIV was achieved following the induction of histone crotonylation through increased expression of the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2). This reprogrammed the local chromatin at the HIV LTR through increased histone acetylation and reduced histone methylation. Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of ACSS2 diminished histone crotonylation-induced HIV replication and reactivation. ACSS2 induction was highly synergistic in combination with either a protein kinase C agonist (PEP005) or a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) in reactivating latent HIV. In the SIV-infected nonhuman primate model of AIDS, the expression of ACSS2 was significantly induced in intestinal mucosa in vivo, which correlated with altered fatty acid metabolism. Our study links the HIV/SIV infection-induced fatty acid enzyme ACSS2 to HIV latency and identifies histone lysine crotonylation as a novel epigenetic regulator for HIV transcription that can be targeted for HIV eradication. © 2018 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

abstract={Histone crotonylation is a new lysine acylation type of post-translational modification (PTM) enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in yeast and mammalian cells. However, lysine crotonylation in nonhistone proteins and plant cells has not yet been studied. In the present study, we performed a global crotonylation proteome analysis of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) using high-resolution LC-MS/MS coupled with highly sensitive immune-affinity purification. A total of 2044 lysine modification sites distributed on 637 proteins were identified, representing the most abundant lysine acylation proteome reported in the plant kingdom. Similar to lysine acetylation and succinylation in plants, lysine crotonylation was related to multiple metabolism pathways, such as carbon metabolism, the citrate cycle, glycolysis, and the biosynthesis of amino acids. Importantly, 72 proteins participated in multiple processes of photosynthesis, and most of the enzymes involved in chlorophyll synthesis were modified through crotonylation. Numerous crotonylated proteins were implicated in the biosynthesis, folding, and degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Several crotonylated proteins related to chromatin organization are also discussed here. These data represent the first report of a global crotonylation proteome and provide a promising starting point for further functional research of crotonylation in nonhistone proteins. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Objective Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone posttranslational modification, which is specifically enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. Although lysine crotonylation sites can be correctly identified with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the experimental methods are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods to deal with this problem. Methods We proposed a new encoding scheme named position weight amino acid composition to extract sequence information of histone around crotonylation sites. We chose protein data from Uniprot database. A series of steps were used to construct a strict and objective benchmark dataset for training and testing the proposed method. All samples were characterized by a significant number of features derived from position weight amino acid composition. The support vector machine was used to perform classification. Results Based on a series of experiments, we found that the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) were respectively 71.69%, 98.7%, 94.43%, and 0.778 in jackknife cross-validation. Comparison results demonstrated that our proposed model was better than random forest algorithm. We also performed the feature analysis on samples. Conclusion Identification of the Kcr sites in histone is an indispensable step for decoding protein function. Therefore, the method can promote the deep understanding of the physiological roles of crotonylation and provide useful information for developing drugs to treat various diseases associated with crotonylation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation is a newly discovered protein post-Translational modification and was reported to share transferases and deacylases with lysine acetylation. The acetyltransferase p300 was reported to also contain crotonyltransferase activity, and class I histone deacetylases were demonstrated to be the major histone decrotonylases. However, the decrotonylases for nonhistone proteins are unclear. Moreover, because of the lack of high-quality pan-Antibodies, large-scale analysis of crotonylome still remains a challenge. In this work, we comprehensively studied lysine crotonylome on both histones and nonhistone proteins upon SAHA treatment and dramatically identified 10 163 lysine crotonylation sites in A549 cells. This is the first identification of tens of thousands of lysine crotonylation sites and also the largest lysine crotonylome data set up to now. Moreover, a parallel-reaction-monitoring-based experiment was performed for validation, which presented highly consistent results with the SILAC experiments. By intensive bioinformatic analysis, it was found that lysine crotonylation participates in a wide range of biological functions and processes. More importantly, it was revealed that both the crotonylation and acetylation levels of most core histones sites and a number of nonhistone proteins as well as some known substrates of class IIa and IIb HDACs were up-regulated after SAHA treatment. These results suggest that SAHA may have decrotonylation inhibitory activities on both histones and nonhistone proteins by inhibiting HDACs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={As one of the most important and common histones post-translational modifications, crotonylation plays a key role in regulating various biological processes. The accurate identification of crotonylation sites is crucial to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of crotonylation. In this study, a novel bioinformatics tool named CKSAAP_CrotSite is developed to predict crotonylation sites. The highlight of CKSAAP_CrotSite is to adopt the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs as input encoding, and the support vector machine is employed as the classifier. As illustrated by jackknife test, CKSAAP_CrotSite achieves a promising performance with a Sensitivity of 92.45%, a Specificity of 99.17%, an Accuracy of 98.11% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.9283, which is much better than those of the existing prediction methods. Feature analysis shows that some amino acid pairs such as ‘KxG’, ‘KG’ and ‘PxP’ may play an important role in the prediction of crotonylation sites. The results of analysis and prediction could offer useful information for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of crotonylation and related experimental validations. A user-friendly web-server for CKSAAP_CrotSite is available at 123.206.31.171/CKSAAP_CrotSite/. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly identified histone modification that is associated with active transcription in mammalian cells. Here we report that the chromodomain Y-like transcription corepressor CDYL negatively regulates histone Kcr by acting as a crotonyl-CoA hydratase to convert crotonyl-CoA to β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. We showed that the negative regulation of histone Kcr by CDYL is intrinsically linked to its transcription repression activity and functionally implemented in the reactivation of sex chromosome-linked genes in round spermatids and genome-wide histone replacement in elongating spermatids. Significantly, Cdyl transgenic mice manifest dysregulation of histone Kcr and reduction of male fertility with a decreased epididymal sperm count and sperm cell motility. Our study uncovers a biochemical pathway in the regulation of histone Kcr and implicates CDYL-regulated histone Kcr in spermatogenesis, adding to the understanding of the physiology of male reproduction and the mechanism of the spermatogenic failure in AZFc (Azoospermia Factor c)-deleted infertile men. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recent studies on enzymes and reader proteins for histone crotonylation support a function of histone crotonylation in transcription. However, the enzyme(s) responsible for histone decrotonylation (HDCR) remains poorly defined. Moreover, it remains to be determined if histone crotonylation is physiologically significant and functionally distinct from or redundant to histone acetylation. Here we present evidence that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) rather than sirtuin family deacetylases (SIRTs) are the major histone decrotonylases, and that histone crotonylation is as dynamic as histone acetylation in mammalian cells. Notably, we have generated novel HDAC1 and HDAC3 mutants with impaired HDAC but intact HDCR activity. Using these mutants we demonstrate that selective HDCR in mammalian cells correlates with a broad transcriptional repression and diminished promoter association of crotonylation but not acetylation reader proteins. Furthermore, we show that histone crotonylation is enriched in and required for self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Lysine crotonylation on histones is a recently identified post-translational modification that has been demonstrated to associate with active promoters and to directly stimulate transcription. Given that crotonyl-CoA is essential for the acyl transfer reaction and it is a metabolic intermediate widely localized within the cell, we postulate that lysine crotonylation on nonhistone proteins could also widely exist. Using specific antibody enrichment followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis, we identified hundreds of crotonylated proteins and lysine residues. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that crotonylated proteins are particularly enriched for nuclear proteins involved in RNA processing, nucleic acid metabolism, chromosome organization, and gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that crotonylation regulates HDAC1 activity, expels HP1α from heterochromatin, and inhibits cell cycle progression through S-phase. Our data thus indicate that lysine crotonylation could occur in a large number of proteins and could have important regulatory roles in multiple nuclei-related cellular processes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Recognition of histone covalent modifications by 'reader modules constitutes a major mechanism for epigenetic regulation. A recent upsurge of newly discovered histone lysine acylations, such as crotonylation (Kcr), butyrylation (Kbu), and propionylation (Kpr), greatly expands the coding potential of histone lysine modifications. Here we demonstrate that the histone acetylation-binding double PHD finger (DPF) domains of human MOZ (also known as KAT6A) and DPF2 (also known as BAF45d) accommodate a wide range of histone lysine acylations with the strongest preference for Kcr. Crystal structures of the DPF domain of MOZ in complex with H3K14cr, H3K14bu, and H3K14pr peptides reveal that these non-acetyl acylations are anchored in a hydrophobic 'dead-end' pocket with selectivity for crotonylation arising from intimate encapsulation and an amide-sensing hydrogen bonding network. Immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that MOZ and H3K14cr colocalize in a DPF-dependent manner. Our studies call attention to a new regulatory mechanism centered on histone crotonylation readout by DPF family members. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potentially lethal condition for which no therapy is available beyond replacement of renal function. Posttranslational histone modifications modulate gene expression and kidney injury. Histone crotonylation is a recently described posttranslational modification. We hypothesized that histone crotonylation might modulate kidney injury. Histone crotonylation was studied in cultured murine proximal tubular cells and in kidneys from mice with AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin. Histone lysine crotonylation was observedintubularcells from healthy murine and human kidney tissue. Kidney tissue histone crotonylation increased during AKI. This was reproducedbyexposure tothe protein TWEAK incultured tubular cells. Specifically, ChIP-seq revealed enrichment of histone crotonylation at the genes encoding the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC-1α and the sirtuin-3 decrotonylase in both TWEAK-stimulated tubular cells and in AKI kidney tissue. To assess the role of crotonylation in kidney injury, crotonate was used to increase histone crotonylation in cultured tubular cells or in the kidneys in vivo. Crotonate increased the expression of PGC-1α and sirtuin-3, and decreased CCL2 expression in cultured tubular cells and healthy kidneys. Systemic crotonate administration protected from experimental AKI, preventing the decrease in renal function and in kidney PGC-1α and sirtuin-3 levels as well as the increase in CCL2 expression. For the first time, we have identified factors such as cell stress and crotonate availability that increase histone crotonylation in vivo. Overall, increasing histone crotonylation might have a beneficial effect on AKI. This is the first observation of the in vivo potential of the therapeutic manipulation of histone crotonylation in a disease state. © 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={Recognition of histone covalent modifications by chromatin-binding protein modules ("readers") constitutes a major mechanism for epigenetic regulation, typified by bromodomains that bind acetyllysine. Non-acetyl histone lysine acylations (e.g., crotonylation, butyrylation, propionylation) have been recently identified, but readers that prefer these acylations have not been characterized. Here we report that the AF9 YEATS domain displays selectively higher binding affinity for crotonyllysine over acetyllysine. Structural studies revealed an extended aromatic sandwiching cage with crotonyl specificity arising from π-aromatic and hydrophobic interactions between crotonyl and aromatic rings. These features are conserved among the YEATS, but not the bromodomains. Using a cell-based model, we showed that AF9 co-localizes with crotonylated histone H3 and positively regulates gene expression in a YEATS domain-dependent manner. Our studies define the evolutionarily conserved YEATS domain as a family of crotonyllysine readers and specifically demonstrate that the YEATS domain of AF9 directly links histone crotonylation to active transcription. Li et al. demonstrate that the YEATS domain has an expanded acyl-binding repertoire with highest preference for crotonyllysine. The AF9 YEATS-crotonyllysine interaction is critical for histone crotonylation-dependent gene activation in the context of the inflammatory response. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Acetylation of histones at DNA regulatory elements plays a critical role in transcriptional activation. Histones are also modified by other acyl moieties, including crotonyl, yet the mechanisms that govern acetylation versus crotonylation and the functional consequences of this "choice" remain unclear. We show that the coactivator p300 has both crotonyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities, and that p300-catalyzed histone crotonylation directly stimulates transcription to a greater degree than histone acetylation. Levels of histone crotonylation are regulated by the cellular concentration of crotonyl-CoA, which can be altered through genetic and environmental perturbations. In a cell-based model of transcriptional activation, increasing or decreasing the cellular concentration of crotonyl-CoA leads to enhanced or diminished gene expression, respectively, which correlates with the levels of histone crotonylation flanking the regulatory elements of activated genes. Our findings support a general principle wherein differential histone acylation (i.e., acetylation versus crotonylation) couples cellular metabolism to the regulation of gene expression. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The haploid male germ cell differentiation program controls essential steps of male gametogenesis and relies partly on a significant number of sex chromosome-linked genes. These genes need to escape chromosome-wide transcriptional repression of sex chromosomes, which occurs during meiosis and is largely maintained in post-meiotic cells. A newly discovered histone lysine modification, crotonylation (Kcr), marks X/Y-linked genes that are active in post-meiotic male germ cells. Histone Kcr, by conferring resistance to transcriptional repressors, could be a dominant element in maintaining these genes active in the globally repressive environment of haploid cell sex chromosomes. Furthermore, the same mark was found associated with post-meiotically activated genes on autosomes. Histone Kcr therefore appears to be an indicator of the male haploid cell gene expression program and a notable element of genome programming in the post-meiotic phases of spermatogenesis. © 2012 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={We report the identification of 67 previously undescribed histone modifications, increasing the current number of known histone marks by about 70%. We further investigated one of the marks, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), confirming that it represents an evolutionarily-conserved histone posttranslational modification. The unique structure and genomic localization of histone Kcr suggest that it is mechanistically and functionally different from histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
